                        <p>
                            At Pillbox Hospital, the safety and well-being of our patients and staff are our top priorities. We believe that our policies regarding patients and visitors are essential to ensure a safe and healthy environment for everyone who enters our facility. Therefore, we require all patients and visitors to comply with the following guidelines: 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <h3>
                                        Infection Control: Infection prevention is critical to the health and safety of our patients and staff. All visitors must practice good hygiene, including washing hands frequently and using hand sanitizers available throughout the hospital. Visitors with cold or flu-like symptoms or who have recently been exposed to contagious diseases should not visit the hospital.
                                    </h3>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        Healing Environment: Here at Pillbox, we pride ourselves in being a healing environment, which means violence of any kind will not be tolerated. This may include: Hitting, shooting, tackling, killing, kidnapping, or handcuffing* 
                                    </h3>
                                </li>

                                        Visitors Limit: To ensure the comfort and safety of all patients, we limit the number of visitors allowed in a patient's room at any one time. The specific number of visitors allowed may vary from department to department.
                                    </h3>
                                </li>

                                        Solicitation: In order to have our team work effectively as possible, it's imperative that only the necessary people be inside the hospital at all times. Solicitation can make it extremely hard for medical staff to get a patient to the proper facilities to treat them, and it could cost someone their life.
                                    </h3>
